# Terra Wallet Controller

This is a sub-structure of the [`@coin-acc-aptos/wallet-provider`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@coin-acc-aptos/wallet-provider).

You can use it when you want to develop in a framework other than React.

This is not yet properly equipped with documents compared to wallet-provider, and may be more difficult to use than react hooks.
